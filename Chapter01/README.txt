Chapter 1 Exercises

1. Run the "hello, world" program on your system.

3. Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.

4. Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table.

5. Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order,
   that is, from 300 degrees to 0.

6. Verify that the expression "getchar() != EOF" is 0 or 1.

7. Write a program to print the value of EOF.

8. Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.

9. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or
   more blanks by a single blank.

10. Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by \t, each 
    newline by \n, and each backslash by \\. This makes tabs and newlines visible in
    an unamiguous way.

12. Write a program that prints its input one word per line.

13. Write a program to print a histogram of the length of words in its input.

14. Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters.

15. Rewrite the temperature conversion program to use a function for conversion.

16. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will correctly print the 
    length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as much as possible of the text.

17. Write a program to print all input lines longer than 80 characters.

18. Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to 
    delete entire blank lines.

19. Write a function called 'reverse(s)' that reverses the string s. Use it to write a
    program that reverses its input a line at a time.

20. Write a program called detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number
    of blanks to space to the next tab stop. Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every
    n columns.

21. Write a program called entab that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum number
    of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the same tab stops as for detab.
    When either a tab of a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should
    be given preference?

22. Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or more shorter lines after the
    last non-blank character that occurs before the n-th column of input. Make sure your
    program does something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no blanks
    tabs before the specific column.

23. Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted
    strings and character constants properly. C comments do not nest.

24. Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unbalanced
    parentheses, brackets and braces. Don't forget about quotes both single and double,
    escape sequences, and comments.
